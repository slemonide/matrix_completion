    "#### Ignoring first 2 singular values for rank 1 matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "If matrix is rank 1, optimization that ignores first two largest singular values fails in most cases for any number of missing entries. But, sometimes from about **1 entry up to about 4 entries** could be missing and the matrix will be recovered successfully. I have been sampling matrices randomly, so this is probably not a tight bound. This shows that perhaps there are a class of matrices and a class of missing entries for which exact recovery is possible even if we ignore second largest singular value. The number of entries m required for exact recovery of nxn matrix is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ m = C n^b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C = 0.9842 \\pm 0.002051$$\n",
    "$$b = 2.0040 \\pm 0.0004884$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, m is about $m = 0.98 * n^2$. In total, there are $n^2$ entries, so roughly for many randomly sampled matrices, only 2% of entries are required to recover the original matrix even if we don't minimize second singular values explicitly.\n",

    "In this case it seems that the number of required entries m is given by one of the two formulas:\n",
