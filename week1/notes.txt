How do you compute tangent space on the manifold?
Like I can compute the derivatives and I want to find the dimension of the manifold.
Sat 3:14 PM
The tangent space has the same dimension as the manifold
If you can compute the derivatives and find basis vectors for the derivatives, then you will be able to express any element of the tangent space as linear combinations of those basis vectors
If you can find a basis for the derivatives, you can count how many basis vectors there are and then that will be the dimension of the manifold
For example, as you know, on R^n, the tangent space at any point has basis consisting of d/dx1, d/dx2, ..., d/dxn as a basis, evaluated at that point

hm
so I can make a matrix of gradients with each gradient evaluated for different direction in the space that defines a manifold into the ambient space that contains the manifold and then compute the rank of the resultant matrix to get dimension
